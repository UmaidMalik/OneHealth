										<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										A super app in health and fitness including screen time habits is quite a big app. 
										One could say and app with this many goals is counterintuitive to reducing screen time usage. 
										Locking the user out of the app if they spend too much screen time would be a terrible design choice. 
										The choice belongs to the user. 
										The app would only encourage the user to incorporate healthy screen habits and a healthy lifestyle.

									<h2><strong>Understanding the problem<strong></h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Good health and fitness are an important aspect of improving one one's quality of life. 
									There's a correlation with excessive screen time usage being associated with anxiety, 
									sleep issues, weight gain and many other possible physical and mental health effects.
								</p>

								<p>
									Ideally, we would want an app that will encourage the user with healthy screen habits 
									by providing a means to reduce it with physical exercise information, tools to log 
									workouts, a community forum to achieve similar goals, meal planning with analytics, 
									and encouraging good sleep habits.

									<h2><strong>Research</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									The app would have to be designed using the UX/UI design process. 
									To start of the research a google forms survey was created to ask 
									the participant on their thought on health and wellness apps. 
								</p>

							</div>

							<div>	
								<h1><strong>Surveys</strong></h1>
								<p>
									One of the key aspects of health I wanted to ask the participants was of fitness. 
									Whether it be bodyweight training, weight training, yoga, or meditation, I believe 
									that a routine in physical fitness will help in in reducing the overall screen time, 
									stress, improving physical overall health for most people.
								</p>
								
							</div>

							<div>
								<p>
									<img src="images/habits.png" alt="Habits" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain">
									<p>
										The majority of the participants are getting the recommended or acceptable amount of sleep, However, a sizeable 27.6% are still not getting good night's rest.
									</p>
								</p>
							</div>
		
								
									<img src="images/app-use.png" alt="App Usage" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain">
									<p>
										The participants were asked if they used any fitness apps or nutrition apps. 
										For both questions, 51.7% answered yes. For sleeping apps, only 27.6% answered yes. 
										Even less so for mood tracking apps at 13.8% responding with yes.
									</p>

							<div>
								<img src="images/fitness-activity-type.png" alt="Fitness Activity" style="height: 80%; width: 80%; object-fit: contain">
								<p>
									With the pandemic going on, most of the participants exercise at home now with or with any equipment.
								</p>
							
							</div>

							<div>
								<img src="images/key-fitness-goals.png" alt="Key Fitness Goals" style="height: 80%; width: 80%; object-fit: contain">
								<p>
									This was an important question to ask the participants. It was important 
									to know what the user would be looking for the right app. It is essential 
									to understand their goals and make sure the goals of the user align with 
									the features provided by the app. Knowing their goals makes it easier to 
									generate user personas. 
								</p>

								<p>
									For survey question, it was realized that most users would want to improve 
									their mobility, lose weight, sleep better, gain muscle, build strength, more 
									endurance, and have more confidence and energy. It was understood that there 
									are many reasons to stay active.
								</p>

							<div>
								<img src="images/training-hindrances.png" alt="Training Hindrances" style="height: 80%; width: 80%; object-fit: contain">
							<p>
								Time, motivation, and work are the strong contributors preventing the participants 
								from exercising as much as they like to. 
								Family balance, confidence, and knowledge in exercise are the minor contributors.
							</p>
							</div>

							<p>
								Upon asking the survey participants on the benefits and/or drawbacks of health related 
								apps, many matters were learned. One person wrote that they would be a general benefit 
								especially during pandemic times. Another wrote a drawback on having unnecessary 
								pressures on an app planning your diets and fitness routines.
							</p>

							<p>
								Most of the participants found that social media apps were detrimental to your health 
								and well-being. 
							</p>

							<p>
								“Ones that make you compare yourself to other 
								people and ones that encourage you to stay on them as long as possible.”
							</p>

							<p>
								On asking about the types of apps the participants find to improve their healthy habits, 
								it was revealed that reminder apps, sleep tracking apps, meal logging, and workout logging 
								apps would be the heart of improving their healthy habits. 
							</p>

							<p>
								“Apps that you can log workouts and meals into, or apps that that time your screen usage 
								and send many notifications to you for reminders.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The kinds of apps that the participants find could increase their happiness would be 
								apps that encourage fitness and working towards a goal.
							</p>

							<p>
								“Apps that show you how to workout at home without equipment.”
							</p>

							<p>
								“Apps that encourage fitness and working towards goals.”
							</p>

							<p>
								“Apps where I can connect with other people, meditation, etc.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Every person has different needs but they are not all too different. 
								The survey helped in knowing the what the user’s value and require 
								of a health and fitness app. All the survey information is valuable 
								in creating user personas.

									feel refreshed. For Archies case, being a desk jockey and not being

									so downloading the app would be her trying to get her foot in the door.

									goals. He would want to be part of community with similar goal. A 
									community forum will allow him to post question and write about
